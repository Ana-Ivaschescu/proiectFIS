Hello, this repo contains a GUI JavaFx App, named Basketball Connects developed by Ivaschescu Ana and Stroia Dacian.

The app aims to facilitate communication between Player Agents and Team Managers.
A Team Manager has a team and is looking for players. A Player Agent represents a lot of players who search for a team. Thanks to this app everyone finds what they are looking for!

There is a Sign Up/Sign In Welcome page and during Sign Up the user chooses his role. The password of the user is encrypted for safety reasons.

 A Team Manager can add/edit/view his team data, view player agents and their players, search the players by playing position and request a certain player.
 
 A Player Agent can see a list of Team Managers and their team and a list of the players he represents. He cand add and edit players and accept/deny a request for a certain player.
 
 Enjoy Basketball Connects!
